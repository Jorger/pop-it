# 🫧 Pop It

![Poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jorger/pop-it/refs/heads/main/poster_pop_it.png)

Pop It is a strategic two-player game where players take turns pressing down any number of bubbles, as long as they are in the same row and pressed consecutively. Every move reduces the available bubbles and increases the tension.

But be careful…

⚠️ Don’t pop the last bubble, or you’ll lose!

The player who presses the final bubble loses the game.
Think ahead, outsmart your opponent, and force them into the losing move.
